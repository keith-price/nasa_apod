<<<<<<< HEAD

1. Need heading on the archive page to make it clear what we are looking at.

2. Remove dummy data and fetch images from Cloud Firestore

3. Header on any page with scrolling should fade out as the user scrolls up, fade back in with user scrolls back to top

4. Archive page needs paging, limited amount of images to be displayed and then the user can go to next page, page number 3 etc

5. Add footer

6. Research design. Current design isn't clean enough. Needs to be simple, clean and not take away from the images themselves. Design should feel 'spacey'

7. Clicking on an image on the archive page should open a modal that shows the title, image and explanation (same as image component)

8. # Write to Cloud Firestore should only happen once per day, not on every render and page refresh. Add some kind of timeout to make this happen only once per day.

9. Need user content page, users can upload their own photos with title and description, following the model.

10. Need ability to share images - social media stuff

11. # Archive doesn't update unless the app is online (this will happen daily once app is deployed)
