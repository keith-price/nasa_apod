1. # Need to figure out onClick - onClickHandler to get Link to open up ArchiveDetail + image-title to use for a get request.

2. Add footer

3. Header on any page with scrolling should fade out as the user scrolls up, fade back in with user scrolls back to top

4. Archive page needs paging, limited amount of images to be displayed and then the user can go to next page, page number 3 etc

5. # Write to Cloud Firestore should only happen once per day, not on every render and page refresh. Add some kind of timeout to make this happen only once per day.
