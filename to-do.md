1.  Write to Cloud Firestore should only happen once per day, not on every render and page refresh. Add some kind of timeout to make this happen only once per day.

2.  Clicking on an image on the archive page should open a modal that shows the title, image and explanation (same as image component)

3. Add footer

4.  Need user content page, users can upload their own photos with title and description, following the model.

5. Research design. Current design isn't clean enough. Needs to be simple, clean and not take away from the images themselves. Design should feel 'spacey'

6. Need heading on the archive page to make it clear what we are looking at.

7. Need ability to share images - social media stuff

8. Archive page needs paging, limited amount of images to be displayed and then the user can go to next page, page number 3 etc
