1. Create archive page. Need to store data in JSON format for each day's apod. That JSON data will then be used to create the archive page which will display the last X number of days pictures. Users should be able to click on a thumbnail and get a single page for that image with heading and description.

2. Need user content page, users can upload their own photos with title and description, following the model.

3. Focus on layout for small laptop.

4. Convert frontend to React (already added main components - layout needs work)

5. Store data locally in JSON format to test and in order to build out the archive page - later move this to a database (Firebase?)
